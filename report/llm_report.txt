The policy is **Partially Compliant** with GDPR.

**Justification:**

The policy covers 51.03% of the articles in the GDPR regulation, indicating a moderate level of compliance. However, there are several areas where the policy falls short:

* Articles below threshold (≤0.5): Articles 73, 72, and 99 are not fully covered by the policy.
* Partially covered articles (0.5–0.7): Articles 16, 31, 48, and 63 are partially covered, but with significant gaps in their explanation.
* Not covered articles (≤0.5): Several articles, including 50, 77, and 86, are not mentioned at all.

To improve compliance, the policy should:

1. **Provide detailed explanations** for partially covered articles, ensuring that they meet the minimum requirements of GDPR.
2. **Address gaps** in coverage for Articles 73, 72, and 99 by providing more specific guidance or alternatives.
3. **Include relevant examples** to illustrate how each article applies to real-world scenarios.

By addressing these areas, the policy can be further strengthened to ensure a higher level of compliance with GDPR regulations.

**Recommendations:**

1. Review and revise Article 73 to provide clear guidelines on data protection by design and default.
2. Enhance explanations for Articles 16, 31, and 48 to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements of GDPR.
3. Develop examples and case studies to illustrate how each article applies to real-world scenarios.

By implementing these recommendations, the policy can become more comprehensive and effective in ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations.
