AHA-Privacy-Policy-2021.pdf
1. Information We Collect and How We Use It
AHA collects information from several sources that enables AHA to identify or contact you (“Personal
Information”). An AHA website collects Personal Information in a variety of manners and the types of
Personal Information we may collect from you will depend on the products and services you choose.
Our Web server automatically collects the domain name and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address for
each visitor to our websites. We collect information about the usage of our websites. In addition, we may request or require you to provide Personal Information and/or create an account in order to
access certain services or engage in certain activities on an AHA website. The information collected
depends on how you choose to use our services and our websites, as detailed below.
The types of Personal Information we collect includes, but is not limited to:
•
General information (e.g., your name, date of birth, home and business address, email
address, phone number, and other types of demographic information)
•
Professional information (e.g., occupation, place of employment, professional history)
•
Financial information (e.g., credit card information, billing information)
•
IP addresses
•
Individual responses to surveys
•
Topical areas of interest
•
Website usage (e.g., search terms, referring/exit pages, time on a website, number of clicks)
AHA also collects information that is about you individually, but that does not directly identify you as
you interact with an AHA website (“Non-Personal Information”). The types of Non-Personal
Information we collect includes, but is not limited to:
•
Products and services viewed
•
Internet service provider
•
Geolocation data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Commonly Accepted Practices
Personal Information collected may be used for commonly accepted practices, including:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Product service fulfillment, such as the use of addresses for shipping and credit card
information for payment;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Internal operations, such as the use of identity-verification technologies, and the review of
server logs;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Marketing of products and services to you by AHA, such as the recommendation of products
or the delivery of coupons based upon prior purchases.
We use Non-Personal Information to improve the usability of our websites and for other business
reasons. We or other third party companies also use the Non-Personal Information to provide
advertisements and targeted advertisements to you based on the Non-Personal Information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. Information Collected to Create an Account
There are times when AHA may request or require you to create an account with us in order to
obtain certain services. In such cases we may collect user name or ID and password information
from you. We use this information to verify users’ identities in order to prevent unauthorized access
to users’ personal information. AHA allows account holders to elect to have the AHA website
remember their login information between visits so they do not have to log in each time. This is done
by checking a box labeled “remember me” on the login page. This feature requires the placement of
a small text file called a cookie (see next section) on the user’s hard drive. The cookie tells the site
that the user has logged in before. As part of registering for some of AHA’s products and affiliates,
we may collect contact and demographic information such as your name, address, email address, etc. We may also collect information regarding your personal and professional history, interests,
activities, experiences and interests in health care products and services. Certain information may
be required in order to complete the registration process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c. Cookies
Several portions of the AHA websites use cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred
to your computer through your Web browser. Cookies are used by most websites. We may use
cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (i) store information so that you will not have to re-
enter it during subsequent visits; (ii) provide personalized content on AHA.org and to provide
targeted advertising on other sites; (iii) monitor effectiveness of marketing campaigns; (iv) record site
analytics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (v) track your entries, submissions
and communications. Certain features of our website require cookies in order to function properly.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some AHA website features and services may
not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies. If you view an AHA website without
changing your cookie settings, you are indicating your consent to receive all cookies (that are not
related to third party advertisers and analytics providers) from the AHA website. For more
information on managing cookies operated by third party advertisers and analytics providers, please
see Third Party Advertisers and Analytics below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d. Email Addresses and Mailing Lists
AHA collects and uses the email addresses and mailing addresses of its members (see Section 2.
Members’ Information, below) for purposes of providing membership benefits and services to
members. In addition, AHA collects email and mailing addresses in connection with registration for
and attendance at conferences, webinars and other events, subscriptions for publications, the
purchase of products and services, and in other circumstances. We may use your email address or
other Personal Information to send commercial or marketing messages to you regarding AHA’s
products or services. In addition, we may also use your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or
other Personal Information (i) to send commercial or marketing messages on behalf of our affiliated
organizations or on behalf of unrelated third parties, and/or (ii) in a mailing list sold to third parties for
the marketing of their products and services. For example, we may share contact information you
provide when you register for a conference or webinar with conference exhibitors or webinar
sponsors so that they may send you commercial messages. You may opt-out of any or all of such
disclosures as provided below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e. Surveys
Our online surveys may ask respondents for contact, demographic and other Personal Information.
The ways in which such information may be used or disclosed will be described in the survey
materials. We also may use contact information from our surveys to send the user information about
products and services of AHA, our affiliated organizations and/or unrelated third parties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f. Information from Other Sources
The information we collect is gathered from several sources. Such sources may include, but are not
limited to: membership enrollment; conference, webinar, distance learning and other event
registration; website visits; newsletter and magazine subscriptions; and product sales. We may
combine the information you submit when using one of our services with information (i) collected
from your use of other AHA services, (ii) collected by AHA affiliated organizations, or (iii) obtained from third parties. The combined information may be used in a similar manner to any other
information we collect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Members’ Information
The AHA and its affiliated organizations offer individuals and institutions the opportunity to become
members of the AHA and its affiliates. As part of membership enrollment, we may require or ask you
for Personal Information and/or organizational information. We will create a member profile for you
using such information and other information collected as described in this Privacy Policy. We may
share the information in the member profile created with respect to membership in one AHA
organization with other AHA affiliated organizations. The information you submit as part of your
membership may also be used to compile a member directory or a list of persons registered to
attend an event (either hardcopy or electronic). Such directories and lists may be shared with other
members within a group, other registrants or third parties for marketing of their products and
services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Public Profiles
Some or all of the information AHA collects from you as part of registrations of certain products and
affiliates may be maintained in your account profile. This account profile will be visible to third parties
accessing an AHA website except as set forth herein. We may make tools available for you in your
account settings that will enable you to limit some of the data that will appear to third parties in your
account profile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Third Party Advertisers and Analytics
This Privacy Policy applies to AHA websites only. We may allow third party ad servers or ad
networks to serve advertisements within AHA’s websites. These third party ad servers or ad
networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear
on the website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may use other
technologies such as cookies, scripting language or clear gifs to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. They may also collect non-personal and
personal information concerning your online activities over time and across different websites. The
information they may collect includes the other sites you have visited or applications that you have
downloaded to your mobile device, and other information about you or your device in order to help
analyze and serve targeted advertising on the AHA website and elsewhere. For more information
about third party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third parties,
please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory
Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
We may use a data analytics firm, such as Google Analytics, Ping Identity and Marketo to track and
analyze traffic on an AHA website. These companies use cookies and similar technologies to collect
and analyze information about use of the AHA website and report on activities and trends. This
service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources.
You can learn about Google’s privacy practices by reviewing their privacy terms, currently found at
https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites, and you can opt out of providing analytics by
downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can learn about Ping Identity privacy practices
available at https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/privacy.html. AHA does not provide any Personal Information to these third party ad servers or ad networks
without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the
ability to opt-in or opt-out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. “Do Not Track” and Global Privacy Control
Signals
Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to
websites and online services you visit. When you choose to turn on the “Do Not Track” settings in
your browser, your browser will send a signal to websites, analytics providers, advertisements
networks, plug-in providers, and other web service providers you encounter while browsing to stop
tracking your activity. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use
to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online
tracking. To find out more about and set up GPC, please visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Social Media Interactions and Third Party
Links
AHA’s websites and publications contain many links to other websites. In addition, AHA and its
affiliates may maintain a presence on third party sites such as Facebook® or LinkedIn®. These third
party sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. AHA is
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites. Please review each site’s
privacy policy to learn about how they may collect or use information.
AHA websites may contain functionality that enables you to import profile information or contacts
from third party services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc.) (collectively, “Third Party
Accounts”). If you choose to do this, you may have to log into the applicable Third Party Account,
using such account’s user name and password. The copy of the information received by us shall be
subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any data maintained by in Third Party Accounts and by such
third party service and your use of that third party service will be subject to that third party’s separate
terms of use and privacy policy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Information Sharing
In addition to the information sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, the AHA shares
Personal Information with AHA affiliated organizations and other trusted businesses or persons to
perform functions on our behalf. These third parties have access to Personal Information needed to
perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
In the unlikely event that AHA or one of its affiliated organizations is acquired, or substantially all of
the assets of AHA or one of its affiliated organizations are acquired, by a third party either in a sale,
bankruptcy court proceeding or otherwise it is possible that Personal Information of website users
and customers would be one of the assets transferred. In such an event, AHA would take
reasonable steps to require the third party to maintain our privacy policies and practices.
In addition, AHA may disclose Personal Information to third parties, but only: 1. to contractors we use to support our business, provided they only use the Personal
Information for AHA purposes;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. to respond to law enforcement requests, where required by applicable laws, court orders,
warrants, subpoenas (whether civil or criminal) or governmental regulations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Information Security
AHA implements commercially reasonable security measures to help protect against unauthorized
access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. Please understand that no
one can give an absolute assurance that information intended to be maintained as private, whether
transmitted via the Internet or otherwise, cannot be accessed inappropriately or unlawfully by third
parties. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a computer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Children’s Privacy
The AHA website is not intended for children under eighteen (18) years of age. AHA does not
knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about any such children, and AHA does not
knowingly market its products or services to any such children. If AHA becomes aware that it has
inadvertently received personal information from a User under the age of eighteen (18), it will delete
such personal information from its records.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Consent to Transfer
AHA is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by United States law.
By accessing or using an AHA website or providing us with any information, you consent to the
transfer, processing and storage of your information in and to the United States and other countries,

you reside and/or are a citizen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
AHA MAY MODIFY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ANY TIME, AND ANY CHANGE WILL BE
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING OF THE MODIFIED PRIVACY POLICY. YOU
AGREE TO REVIEW THE PRIVACY POLICY PERIODICALLY TO BE AWARE OF SUCH
MODIFICATIONS AND YOUR CONTINUED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SITE SHALL BE DEEMED
YOUR CONCLUSIVE ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY, AS MODIFIED. THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY WILL BE REFLECTED
IN THE DATE LISTED ABOVE.
IF FOR ANY REASON AHA WOULD LIKE TO USE THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE SUBMITTED
FOR SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT PURPOSES OTHER THAN THOSE OUTLINED AT THE TIME
YOU ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED YOUR INFORMATION, AHA WILL AFFIRMATIVELY REQUEST
PERMISSION FROM YOU TO USE SUCH DATA FOR THOSE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT
PURPOSES PRIOR TO USING THE DATA. 11. Accessing and Updating Personal
Information
You may request access to your Personal Information, corrections and/or deletions of the same by
using the Contact Information set forth below. We will use reasonable, good faith efforts to promptly
address your concerns, subject to legal retention obligations and legitimate business needs.
When making a request, individual users are asked to identify themselves and the information
requested to be accessed, corrected or removed. Please note that there may be circumstances
where we are not required to comply with your requests (e.g., if AHA has an ongoing requirement to
retain your Personal Information for our own business or legal compliance purposes). We may
decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access
is not otherwise required. Correcting or removing data is done free of charge to the user unless
doing so requires a disproportionate effort. After deleting your information from active servers,
copies may remain in our backup system.
Nevada provides its residents with a limited right to opt-out of certain Personal Information sales.
Residents who wish to exercise this sale opt-out rights may submit a request to the AHA Compliance

Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate,
and respond to it.
Health Forum Inc. cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we
cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates
to you.
You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know, correct or delete. However,
Health Forum Inc. does consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently
verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.
Health Forum Inc. will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s
identity or authority to make the request.
For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In
Rights.
Response Timing and Format
Health Forum Inc. will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not
receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at compliance@aha.org. Health Forum Inc. endeavors to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of
its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
period in writing.
If you have an account with us, Health Forum Inc. may deliver our written response to that account. If
you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at
your option.
Any disclosures Health Forum Inc. provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the
verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, Health Forum Inc. will select
a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
Health Forum Inc. does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request
unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
completing your request.
Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights
If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any
time (the “right to opt-out”). Health Forum Inc. does not sell the personal information of consumers we
actually know are less than 16 years old. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may
opt-out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative who provides written
documentation authorizing to act on your behalf) may submit a request to us by visiting the following

Health Forum Inc. California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form
Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)
Do Not Track (“DNT”) and Global Privacy Controls (“GPC”) offered by some web browsers are
settings that automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party
online tracking, including exercising your rights and requesting the web application to disable
tracking you. When you choose to turn on the DNT/GPC setting in your browser, your browser sends
a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web
services you encounter while browsing to exercise your privacy rights and stop tracking your activity.
You can learn more about and set up Do Not Track here and set up GPC here. There is no clear
consensus on what it means to comply with these signals and Health Forum Inc. typically does not
take additional steps in response to them, but we comply with DNT and GPC as specifically required
under applicable law.
